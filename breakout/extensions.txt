Improve user control over bounces
If the ball is coming down toward the right (or left) and
 hits the left (or right)
 1/2 of the paddle, the ball goes back the way it came.
I did this by detecting where the ball collides with the paddle and then return differnt string values in the collision method in paddle class. 
Then in the play class's collision method, I modify the motion of the ball differntly based on the returned value. 

Implement sound effects
If the ball collide with the bricks, a sound
 is played when brick is removed.
I did this by creating a sound object and play it every time the ball hits a brick. 
(The game may take a little time to load the sound when the ball collides with the first brick)

Keep score
A score is at the right corner at the top of the screen. It increases every time the ball collides with a brick. The higher the brick is, the more the score increases. 
I did this by adding a _score attribute to the Play class. Every time the ball hits a brick, the score increases by a certain amount based on what the y attibute of the brick is. (a= i.y-(GAME_HEIGHT -BRICK_Y_OFFSET-BRICK_ROWS*(BRICK_HEIGHT
+BRICK_SEP_V))) I made the amount a this way because I don't want the score to be negative and I don't want it to be a huge number.
